Using Fusion 360 I designed the main firing compartment for the turret. I used flywheels from a nerf blaster to propell the foam bullets forward.
I used a 5V blower fan to push the bullets into the flywheels where a custom designed pipe had to be created in fusion 360. A small 5V mini
servo is also installed into into the firing component, this is to stop the flow on bullets from entering the firing chamber and to prevent
further blocks.

The ball are stored inside a hopper above the main chasis where can be refilled using a screwable lid. A custom made wheel is attached to a
coupler and then atttached to a high tourque dc motor. When the motor turns it will push balls into the firing chamber if the mini servo 
is retrached. The enclosure is made of a plastic so you can see the amount of bullets remaining in the hooper.

installed on the main chaisis the the camera holder, this holds the camera which is necessary for object detection algorithms
